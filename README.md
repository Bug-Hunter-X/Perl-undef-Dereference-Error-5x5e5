This repository demonstrates a common Perl error involving attempting to dereference an undefined scalar variable. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from the misuse of the double-dollar sigil ($$) which expects a reference, but receives an undefined value. The solution showcases how to properly check for undefined values before dereferencing.
